# Additional context

## Main invariants

The main invariants are already detailed in the readme.

‚úÖ SCOUTS: Please format the response above üëÜ so its not a wall of text and its readable.

## Attack ideas (where to focus for bugs)
- a blacklisted user circumventing token transfer restrictions in any of the transfer states defined in UStb token contract.
- any user circumventing token transfers in a FULLY_DISABLED transfer state in UStb token contract.
- collateral being accessed in an unexpected way in the UStb minting contract

‚úÖ SCOUTS: Please format the response above üëÜ so its not a wall of text and its readable.

## All trusted roles in the protocol

- DEFAULT_ADMIN - can assign roles to themselves or others and has the ability to perform any action
- MINTER - has the ability to call the mint function in UStb minting contract
- REDEEMER - has the ability to call the redeem function in UStb minting contract
- GATEKEEPER - has the ability to disable minting and redeeming
- BLACKLIST_MANAGER - has the ability to blacklist addresses
- WHITELIST_MANAGER - has the ability to whitelist addresses
